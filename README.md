## About the Project

Did you know that American Sign Language (ASL) serves as the primary language for the vibrant deaf community in North America and beyond? It's a captivating blend of hand movements, facial expressions, and body postures.

In this project, we explore the power of ASL and the significance of finger/hand spelling. Finger spelling is used to communicate names, locations, and more. It acts as a bridge when encountering dialectal differences between regions.

ASL, while not the only sign language, plays a crucial role for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. It involves handshapes, palm orientation, location, movement, and expressive facial gestures.

Fun Fact: Approximately 15% of adults in America experience hearing loss, with over 1 million people using sign language as their means of communication.
